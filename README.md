# Requirements
- Implement basic logic: turn-based logic, win calculation, no playing a square that is already occupied, etc.
- Assume 2 human players (no AI)
- You can build a 3x3 board size for the UI, but your win logic should support an NxN board size
- You must have some portion of business logic handled on the server that you submit via AJAX. The split of client/server logic can be up to your design.
- UI design is up to you.
